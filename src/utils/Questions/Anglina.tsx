  "King Camp Gillette was born in 1855 in a small town in central Wisconsin. His parents were innovators, who were always seeking to do things better. His father worked at various inventions and his mother created numerous recipes through experimentation. At the age of 18, King left school to begin working for a living as a traveling salesman. He did this work for years, often trying his hand at various inventions to improve the products he sold. By 1890, he had accumulated four patents, but none of the inventions gathered much interest. Meanwhile, his parents seemed so much more successful than he. At the age of 40, Gillette went back to his roots in Wisconsin, working as a salesman for Crown Cork & Seal Co. The owner of the company had invented the cork-lined bottle cap. He knew Gillette wanted to be a successful inventor, so he told him to invent something people could use and throw away. This thought stuck in the back of Gillette’s mind. Shortly afterwards, as he was getting ready to shave before going to work, King became irritated that his straight-edge razor was dull and would no longer cut. It was so worn out that he could no longer sharpen it. The straight-edge razor was also called the “cut-throat razor” because it was dangerous enough to cut a man’s throat. Salesmen traveling in swaying trains had to be especially careful when trying to shave. Gillette suddenly had a flash of inspiration for a razor that would not need re-sharpening. He had the idea of disposable razor blades that were sharpened by the manufacturer and thrown away when dull. It would also be a razor that was safe to use, as opposed to the dangerous straight-edge razor. Excited by his idea, he went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and asked their metallurgists if it were possible to make a small piece of steel that would hold its sharp edge and be affordable enough to throw away. They said it was impossible. Still determined, he spent evenings working on his idea. He then partnered with inventor William Emery Nickerson to perfect the method. Ironically, Nickerson had been educated at MIT. It took them 5 years and much of their own money to finally find someone who could provide a machine that would automatically sharpen thin sheets of metal so they could be used to shave. Gillette was now 45 years old. They eventually perfected the double-edged safety razor blade, which fit into a specially designed holder with a handle and an adjustable head. Gillette and Nickerson set up the American Safety Razor Company and got their patent in 1901.";
