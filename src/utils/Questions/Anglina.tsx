	"King Camp Gillette was born in 1855 in a small town in central Wisconsin. His parents were innovators, who were always seeking to do things better. His father worked at various inventions and his mother created numerous recipes through experimentation. At the age of 18, King left school to begin working for a living as a traveling salesman. He did this work for years, often trying his hand at various inventions to improve the products he sold. By 1890, he had accumulated four patents, but none of the inventions gathered much interest. Meanwhile, his parents seemed so much more successful than he. At the age of 40, Gillette went back to his roots in Wisconsin, working as a salesman for Crown Cork & Seal Co. The owner of the company had invented the cork-lined bottle cap. He knew Gillette wanted to be a successful inventor, so he told him to invent something people could use and throw away. This thought stuck in the back of Gillette’s mind. Shortly afterwards, as he was getting ready to shave before going to work, King became irritated that his straight-edge razor was dull and would no longer cut. It was so worn out that he could no longer sharpen it. The straight-edge razor was also called the “cut-throat razor” because it was dangerous enough to cut a man’s throat. Salesmen traveling in swaying trains had to be especially careful when trying to shave. Gillette suddenly had a flash of inspiration for a razor that would not need re-sharpening. He had the idea of disposable razor blades that were sharpened by the manufacturer and thrown away when dull. It would also be a razor that was safe to use, as opposed to the dangerous straight-edge razor. Excited by his idea, he went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and asked their metallurgists if it were possible to make a small piece of steel that would hold its sharp edge and be affordable enough to throw away. They said it was impossible. Still determined, he spent evenings working on his idea. He then partnered with inventor William Emery Nickerson to perfect the method. Ironically, Nickerson had been educated at MIT. It took them 5 years and much of their own money to finally find someone who could provide a machine that would automatically sharpen thin sheets of metal so they could be used to shave. Gillette was now 45 years old. They eventually perfected the double-edged safety razor blade, which fit into a specially designed holder with a handle and an adjustable head. Gillette and Nickerson set up the American Safety Razor Company and got their patent in 1901.";

	"Ancient Greek athletes are known to have used special diets and stimulants to strengthen themselves. Strychnine, caffeine, cocaine, and alcohol were often used by cyclists an other endurance athletes in the 19 century. Thomas Hicks ran to victory in the marathon at the 1904 Olympic Games, in St. Louis, with the help of raw egg, injections of strychnine and doses of brandy administered to him during the race. In 1928 the IAAF (athletics) became the first International Sport Federation (IF) to ban doping, but no tests were performed. Meanwhile the problem was made worse by synthetic hormones, invented in the 1930s and in their growing use for doping purposes from the 1950s. The death of Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen during competition at the Olympic Games in Rome 1960 (the autopsy revealed traces of amphetamine) increased the pressure on sports authorities to introduce drug testing with the purpose of stopping it. In 1966 FIFA (football) was among the first IFs to introduce doping tests in its World Championships. In the next year the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instituted its Medical Commission and set up its first list of prohibited substances. Drug tests were later introduced at the Olympic Games in Grenoble and at the Olympic Games in Mexico in 1968. In the year before, the urgency of anti-doping work had been highlighted by another tragic death, that of cyclist Tom Simpson during the Tour de France. Most IFs had introduced drug testing by the 1970s. However, the use of anabolic steroids was becoming widespread, especially in strength events, as there was no way of detecting them yet. A reliable testing method was finally introduced in 1974 and the IOC added anabolic steroids to its list of prohibited substances in 1976. This resulted in a marked increase in the number of doping-related disqualifications in the late 1970s, notably in strength-related sports such as throwing events and weightlifting. Anti-doping work was made more complicated in the 1970s and 1980s by suspicions of state sponsored doping practices in some countries, which were proven in the case of the former German Democratic Republic. The most famous doping case of the 1980s concerned Ben Johnson, the 100-metre champion who tested positive for stanozolol (an anabolic steroid) at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Johnson’s case focused the world’s attention on the problem of doping to an unprecedented degree.";

	"Construction of the first segment of the Tokaido Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka started in 1959. The line opened on 1 October 1964, just in time for the Tokyo Olympics. The line was an immediate success, reaching the 100 million passenger mark in less than three years on 13 July 1967 and one billion passengers in 1976. The first Shinkansen trains ran at speeds of up to 200 km/h, later increasing to 220 km/h. Some of these trains, with their classic bullet-nosed appearance, are still in use for stopping services between Hakata and Osaka. A driving car from one of the original trains is now in the British National Railway Museum in York. Many further models of train had their own special appearance unlike the originals. Shinkansen trains now run regularly at speeds of up to 300 km/h, putting them among the fastest trains running in the world, along with the French TGV, Spanish AVE and German ICE trains. (d) Originally intended to carry passenger and freight trains by day and night, the Shinkansen lines carry only passenger trains. The system shuts down between midnight and 06:00 every day to allow repairs to take place. The few overnight trains that still run in Japan run on the old narrow network which remains beside the Shinkansen. In 2003, Japan Rail Central reported that the Shinkansen’s average arrival time was within 0.1 minutes or 6 seconds of the scheduled time. This includes all natural and human accidents and errors and is calculated from all of about 160,000 trips Shinkansen made. The previous record was from 1997 and was 0.3 minutes or 18 seconds.";

	"Mother Teresa was a humanitarian. This means she did things to help out other people. Her entire life was fully devoted to helping the poor, the sick, the needy and the helpless. She was born in Uskub on August 26, 1910. This city is now called Skopje and is the capital of the Republic of Macedonia. Her birth name was Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. Her father died when she was 8 and she was raised by her mother. She was raised as a Roman Catholic and decided to devote her life to God at a young age. She joined the Sisters of Loreto at the age of 18 to become a missionary to India. A year later she started her missionary work in Darjeeling, India. She learned the local language, Bengali, and taught at the local school. When she was 21, she became a nun and took the name Teresa. She would teach for many years in India, becoming the headmistress at a school in eastern Calcutta. When she was 36 years old she felt the call from God to help the poor of India. She received some basic medical training and then set out to help the sick and needy. This wasn’t an easy task in 1948 India. She had very little support from the authorities and, while trying to feed and help the poorest of the poor, she was herself constantly hungry and even had to beg for food. Soon other women joined her and she formed the Missionaries of Charity. Mother Teresa described the purpose of the Missionaries of Charity as an organization to take care of “the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind – all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to society and are kept away by everyone”. Mother Teresa had ambitious goals and considering where she was at the start, she accomplished amazing things. The Missionaries of Charity originally had 13 members. Today they have over 4,000 nuns who care for people just like Mother Teresa. It wasn’t an easy task to build such an organization and to keep the focus on the poorest people. She worked almost up until her death on September 5, 1997. ";
